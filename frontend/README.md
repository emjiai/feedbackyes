## üé® Customization

### White Labeling
All branding, colors, and UI text are configured in `/data/config.json`:

```json
{
  "brand": {
    "name": "Your Brand",
    "tagline": "Your Tagline",
    "colors": {
      "primary": "#6366f1",
      "secondary": "#8b5cf6"
    }
  }
}
```

### Adding Scenarios
Add new practice scenarios in `/data/scenarios.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "unique-id",
  "title": "Scenario Title",
  "pillar": "communication",
  "difficulty": "medium",
  "description": "Brief description",
  "context": "Detailed context"
}
```

### Voice Models
Configure available voice models in `/data/config.json`:

```json
{
  "models": [
    {
      "id": "openai",
      "name": "OpenAI GPT-4",
      "description": "Advanced language model",
      "default": true
    }
  ]
}
```

## üîå API Integration (Future)

The app is designed for easy backend integration:

1. **Voice APIs**: Replace `voiceService.ts` methods with actual API calls:
   - OpenAI Realtime API for speech-to-speech
   - ElevenLabs for voice synthesis
   - Google Cloud Speech-to-Text

2. **Database**: Replace JSON files with MongoDB or PostgreSQL:
   - User authentication
   - Session storage
   - Analytics data

3. **RAG Pipeline**: Implement retrieval-augmented generation:
   - Vector store (pgvector/Supabase)
   - Knowledge base integration
   - Context-aware responses

## üö¶ Development Commands

```bash
# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production

npm run lint
```

## üì± Responsive Design
